## 🧢 Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)
TPM is a holistic approach to equipment maintenance and is commonly used in manufacturing industries
- It eliminates deficiencies from machines and equipment
- It minimizes or removes defects and detects downtime
- It emphasizes maintenance and improvement of process system and equipment environment
- It increases the operational efficiency of equipment

TPM is the key operational activity for managing quality:
